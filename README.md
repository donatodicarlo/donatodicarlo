ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @donatodicarlo

I am a lecturer in Political Economy at Luiss University and managing director of the Luiss Hub for New Industrial Policy and Economic Governance (LUHNIP).
I hold a PhD in European Political Economy from the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies (MPIfG) in Cologne. 
Before joining Luiss, I was a Max Weber Postdoctoral Fellow (2020/2021) at the European University Institute in Fiesole.
