ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Donato Di Carlo

I am Assistant Professor in Political Economy at the European Institute of the London School of Economics and the founder/director of the Luiss Hub for New Industrial Policy and Economic Governance (LUHNIP).

I hold a PhD in European Political Economy from the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies (MPIfG) in Cologne.

Before joining Luiss, I was a Max Weber Postdoctoral Fellow (2020/2021) at the European University Institute in Fiesole and worked as Senior Researcher at the MPIfG (2020/2023) and as external economic advisor to the Cabinet of the Mayor of Rome.
